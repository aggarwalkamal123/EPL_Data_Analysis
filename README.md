# ⚽ EPL Data Analysis & Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **English Premier League (EPL) dataset** (sourced from Kaggle).  
The main goal was to extract insights into team performances, player statistics, and match outcomes, followed by building an **interactive dashboard** for visualization.

## 📊 Tech Stack
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** → Data cleaning & EDA  
- **Google Colab** → Notebook development  
- **Power BI** → Dashboard creation  
- **MS PowerPoint** → Final presentation

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis
Key steps performed:
1. Data cleaning (handling null values, formatting columns).  
2. Statistical summaries and distributions.  
3. Visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, goal distributions).  
4. Comparative analysis of **Home vs Away performances**.

## 🏟️ Dashboard
The dashboard highlights:
- Total Goals (Home & Away)  
- Wins, Losses, and Draws distribution  
- Top performing teams & players  
- Match outcome trends

## 📌 Key Insights
- Home teams scored significantly more goals compared to away teams.  
- Certain teams consistently dominated across multiple seasons.  
- The distribution of draws was lower than wins/losses, showing competitive outcomes.  
- Goals scored trend indicated increasing attacking playstyles over seasons.
